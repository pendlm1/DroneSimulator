![FarmLand](README/FarmLand.png "FarmLand")
# Instructions
1.    Scene - Stat by building a screen using the images located under the Farm Items menu. Images are optional. On click the image you selected will be enlarged in the window located under the drone. 
2.    Specifications - Once you have selected an image complete the specification and press submit. An error message will be displayed if the information you submitted does not meet the requirements. You must submit at least one object to activate the drone. We recommend that you complete the entire scene before activating the drone so that It does not travel behind your images (This will be fixed in the future). 
3.    Ready - The drone can be activated by pressing the drone image. You can delete an image from the FarmLand widow by clicking the image and pressing the delete button
